            <p>From this article, I learned that good form design is easy to overlook until you run into a frustrating one. In Salim Ansaris article on form best practices, the main idea is that forms should feel simple, fast, and low-effort for users so they actually complete them. A strong form avoids unnecessary fields, keeps the layout clear (usually one column), and breaks long forms into smaller steps to reduce cognitive load. It also matters how fields are labeled. Placing labels above inputs makes them easier to scan, and relying too heavily on placeholder text can hurt usability because the hint disappears once the user starts typing. The article also emphasizes clear error messages, showing formatting requirements near the field, and adding accessibility features like strong contrast and screen reader support.</p>

            <p>A form I think exemplifies best practices is Airbnb's main search form, where users choose where, when, and who. It works well because it uses simple, familiar language that matches how people naturally plan trips. The layout is clean and predictable, so each step feels easy to complete without overthinking. Instead of forcing users into a long list of fields, Airbnb keeps the form short and focused, which lowers effort and makes the search feel easy and fast.</p>

            <p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a></p>

            <p>The article Best Practices for Modals, Overlays, and Dialog Windows clarifies how easily modals can disrupt a user experience when they are used without intention. One key takeaway was that modals should only be used when the user must focus on a specific task, such as confirming an action or entering information. When modals appear unnecessarily or too frequently, they interrupt the users flow and create frustration rather than clarity.</p>

            <p>The article also emphasized the importance of control and predictability. Modals should be triggered by a clear user action, not appear unexpectedly. They should always include obvious ways to exit, such as a visible close button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the Escape key. This stood out to me because poorly designed modals often make users feel trapped or rushed, which negatively affects trust in the interface.</p>

            <p>Overall, this article reinforced that modal design is about respecting the users attention. When used thoughtfully, modals can guide users and support decision-making. When used carelessly, they become obstacles. This perspective will influence how I approach overlays in my own projects, especially when deciding whether a modal is truly necessary or if the content belongs directly on the page.</p>

            <p><a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a></p>

            <p>Visual literacy and visual thinking are about slowing down and really paying attention to what we see instead of consuming images without thinking. While reading the New York Times article I realized how much meaning can come from simply asking questions and observing details. Images do not have one fixed interpretation. What we notice often depends on our own experiences, emotions, and the context we bring to the image. Taking time to look closely turns viewing into an active process rather than a quick reaction.</p>

            <p>A website that encourages visual thinking for me is <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/">Google Arts & Culture.</a> The site presents artwork, artifacts, and interactive stories in ways that invite exploration and curiosity. You can zoom in close to see tiny brushstrokes on a painting, compare artworks side by side, or explore themes through visual stories instead of long paragraphs of text. It makes learning feel like discovery, and it encourages you to form your own connections and ideas. One small drawback is that with so much visual content, it can sometimes feel overwhelming at first. Still, the experience reinforces how much images can teach us when we take time to look and think.</p>
