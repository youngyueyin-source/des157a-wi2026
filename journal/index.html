        <p>From this article, I learned that good form design is easy to overlook until you run into a frustrating one. In Salim Ansaris article on form best practices, the main idea is that forms should feel simple, fast, and low-effort for users so they actually complete them. A strong form avoids unnecessary fields, keeps the layout clear (usually one column), and breaks long forms into smaller steps to reduce cognitive load. It also matters how fields are labeled. Placing labels above inputs makes them easier to scan, and relying too heavily on placeholder text can hurt usability because the hint disappears once the user starts typing. The article also emphasizes clear error messages, showing formatting requirements near the field, and adding accessibility features like strong contrast and screen reader support.</p>

        <p>A form I think exemplifies best practices is Airbnb's main search form, where users choose where, when, and who. It works well because it uses simple, familiar language that matches how people naturally plan trips. The layout is clean and predictable, so each step feels easy to complete without overthinking. Instead of forcing users into a long list of fields, Airbnb keeps the form short and focused, which lowers effort and makes the search feel easy and fast.</p>
